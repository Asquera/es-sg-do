# When a user make a request to elasticsearch then the following roles will be evaluated to see if the user has
# permissions for the request. A request is always associated with an action and is executed against and index (or alias)
# and a type. If a request is executed against all indices (or all types) then the asterix ('*') is needed.
# Every role a user has will be examined if it allows the action against an index (or type). At least one role must match
# for the request to be successful. If no role match then the request will be denied. Currently a match must happen within
# one single role - that means that permissions can not span multiple roles.

# For <permission>, <indexname or alias> and <type> simple wildcards are possible.
# A asterix (*) will match any character sequence (or an empty sequence)
# A question mark (?) will match any single character (but NOT empty character)
# Example: '*my*index' will match 'my_first_index' as well as 'myindex' but not 'myindex1'
# Example: '?kibana' will match '.kibana' but not 'kibana'
# Note: You cannot have a dot (.) in the <permission>, <indexname or alias> or <type> name/wildcard

# For <permission>, <indexname or alias> and <type> are also regular expressions possible.
# You have to pre- and apend a '/' to use regex instead of simple wildcards
# '/<java regex>/'
# Example: '/\S*/' will match any non whitespace characters
# Note: You cannot have a dot (.) in the <permission>, <indexname or alias> or <type> regex
# Use \S instead
# See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html
